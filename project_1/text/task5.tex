\subsubsection{a)}

We know that $\mathbf{v}$ has length $n$ and A is of dimension $n\times n$. The complete solution $\mathbf{v}^*$ has two additional point compared to $\mathbf{v}$, namely the two endpoints $\mathbf{v}_0$ and $ \mathbf{v_{n+1}} $. The relation between m, the length of $\mathbf{v}^*$ and $\mathbf{v}$ is given by $m = n+2$. 

\subsubsection{b)}

When we solve Eq. \ref{Avg} for $\mathbf{v}$ we find $v_i$ for $i = 1,2, \cdots n$. The missing values compared to $\mathbf{v}^*$ are $\mathbf{v}_0$ and $\mathbf{v}_{n+1}$ which are already known.
