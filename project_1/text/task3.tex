Let the interval be partitioned into $n$ intervals such that there are $n$+1 points including the endpoints. 

From the homogenous Dirichlet boundary conditions we have that the endpoints $v_0 = v_{n+1} = 0$.

Define $v_i$ as the discretized approximation to $u_i$ and $\Delta x$ as the step-length in the discretization. The result in Eq. \ref{derivative_approx} is derived from adding the Taylor Expansion for $x_{i+1} $ and $x_{i-1}$ around point $x_i$ for $\Delta x = h$:

The elimination of odd powers explain the order of error $O(\Delta x^2)$. Combining Eq. \ref{poisson_eq} and \ref{derivative_approx} gives us the discretized Poisson equation on the general form:
\begin{align}
    - \frac{v_{i+1} + 2v_{i} - v_{i-1}}{(\Delta x)^2} =  f_i
\end{align}

In our specific example we have that $\Delta x = \frac{x_{max} - x_{min}}{n} = \frac{1}{n}$ for n steps which give $x_i = i \Delta x = \frac{i}{n}$ and $f_i = 100e^{-10x_i} = 100e^{-10(\frac{i}{n})}$. 

And hence our specific Poisson equation can be discretized as:
\begin{align}
    - n^2(v_{i+1} + 2v_{i} - v_{i-1}) = -100e^{-10\frac{i}{n}}
    \label{discretization}
